    <ol>
        <li class="rules">When we talk about something that happened in the past we sometimes want to refer back to something that happened before that time. We can use <span> the past perfect tense </span>(had + past participle) to do this: <i>Mary rang Johnâ€™s doorbell at 8:15 yesterday but John had already left the house.</i></li>
        <li class="rules">We make <span> the third conditional</span> by using the past perfect after 'if' and then 'would have' and the past participle in the second part of the sentence: She wouldn't have been tired if she had gone to bed earlier</li>
        <li class="rules"><span>The simple future </span> tense is used when an action is promised/thought to occur in the future: <i>He will come to New York tomorrow.</i></li>
        <li class="rules">We use <span> might </span> when we are not sure about something:<i> It looks nice, but it might be very expensive.</i></li>
        <li class="rules">When we're talking about something useless, we say <span> to be of no use + gerund</span>: <i>It is no use trying (= there is no purpose in trying) to escape - no one ever gets out of here.</i></li>
        <li class="rules">When "forget" is used with a gerund, it means "to forget that you have done something. When forget is used with an infinitive, it means "to forget that you need to do something.</li>
        <li class="rules">Turn down somthing means to refuse to accept or agree to something, or to refuse someone's request:<i> The bank turned her down for a loan.</i></li>
        <li class="rules">"Despite" means "even though," "notwithstanding," or "regardless of." It's the opposite of "because of/due to," and can be used with a noun or gerund:<i> She had difficulty communicating in French despite all her years of study.</i></li>
        <li class="rules">We use <span> if only </span> + past perfect to talk about a wish to change something that has already happened: <i>If only he had listened to what his friends had been telling him. (He didn't listen.)</i></li>
        <li class="rules">We use an infinitive after <span> the verb order</span>:<i> He ordered the group to leave the building</i>.</li>
